Create directory in Ubuntu:

- Create a new folder for your new jaseci project using `mkdir`,
- Use `ls` command for a list of current directories and files in current working directory.

- Use `cd` command to change directory to the new folder you choose to create,
- After that use `code .` to launch VS Code using WSL; Ubuntu while opening the folder you just created.
  - Note I have not found any other way to open both the folder from Ubuntu and WSL:Ubuntu in VS Code, and you have to have them both using Ubuntu.

- VS Code will automatically launch in a new window, it should look like this, notice in the far left corner in blue it says WSL:Ubuntu, this is what we want!

- VS Code must be using WSL if you are using Windows.

- You can also see the folder is open from the correct place at the top of VS Code, it needs to be from Ubuntu also.
