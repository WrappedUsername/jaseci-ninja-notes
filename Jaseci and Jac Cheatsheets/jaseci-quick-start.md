# Jaseci Quick Start - Not Official Docs

First install all required tools:
```

Create directory in Ubuntu:

- Use `cd` command to change directory to the new folder you choose to create,
- After that use `code .` to launch VS Code using WSL; Ubuntu while opening the folder you just created.
  - Note I have not found any other way to open both the folder from Ubuntu and WSL:Ubuntu in VS Code, and you have to have them both using Ubuntu.
